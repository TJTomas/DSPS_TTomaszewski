# Breakdown of work
Jarrod and I only worked together for a portion of the assignment. We worked closely together on the creation of everything up to figure 5, with him helping me especially with the creation of figure 4. 
However, for homeowrk part 3 (the BPL model), we diverged and did those parts fairly separately. He helped me get a tiertiary understanding of task 2, but other than that we worked separately. We didn't speak to eachother much about the captions for the plots since.
