# Breakdown of work
Jarrod and I worked together for the vast majority of the assignment. We worked closely together on the creation of everything up to figure 5, with him helping me especially with the creation of figure 4. I reviewed all of his work and pointed out a few coding errors and mistakes with his plots, and a few misunderstandings with captions. However, for homework part 3 task 3 (the BPL model), we did those parts fairly separately. All captions were done independently though with minimal feedback from one another.
