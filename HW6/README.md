# Breakdown of work
Jarrod and I worked together for a portion of the assignment. We worked closely together on the creation of everything up to figure 5, with him helping me especially with the creation of figure 4. I reviewed all of his work and pointed out a few coding errors and mistakes with his plots, and a few misunderstandings with captions. However, for homeowrk part 3 part 3 (the BPL model), we did those parts fairly separately. All captions were done independently though with minimal feedback from one another.
