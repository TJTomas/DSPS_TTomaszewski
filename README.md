Repo for PHYS461, Data Science
Brief Statements:
Hello! The reason why I decided to take this class was because it counts as both a computer science class and an upper level physics class. Also, I want to take a class with Professor Bianco.

It is my hope that in this class we will be able to explore aspects of data science for physics (and especially astrophysics) applications. I cam completely new to the data science field, so I know I have a significant amount to learn. I am ectited to learn the general principles of organizing large data sets, and how to actually produce plots based off of large data sets. Additionally, just based off of the inital reading, it would be great to learn about better practices about drawing accurate conclusions from data--eg., not falling victim to survivorship bias. 

The strengths in my background are my abilities to organize people on large, complex projects over long timescales, and my innate ability to break most of the code I touch, no matter which language it's written in, in order to stress test it's robustness.
