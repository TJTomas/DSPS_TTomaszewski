# HW 11
## Work Breakdown:
Jarrod Bieber - I worked with hih on bugfixing some of his code, and he helped me with some sanity checks closer to the end

Katie Moses - She helped me with some of the code in part 6, and I helped her with getting set up with some of the code for the erlier parts.

TJ Tomaszewski - I worked on the majority of this asignment alone, doing pretty much everything in this notebook myself aside from some bugfixing.
