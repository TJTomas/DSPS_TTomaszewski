Accoding to standards established in the lecture on visualizations, this plot automatically violates our guidelines by being a pie chart. According to the video, pie charts, "Should be avoided at all times." Sicne the human eye does not intiutively understand pie chart area well. 
Additioanlly, while the plot has low ambiguity, the data is distorted in the pie chart fortmat. The labels themselves are a bit destracting, as the title is not capitalized correctly, "Phase" is included in every label, and the numbering/lettering of the datapoint is inconsistant, starting with a number and then switching to lettering.

Finally, it seems like this data cannot be duplicated since while the paper does outline it does not give exact dates to compute the time distribution, only rough months. The data can be accessed here:

The bounds are well definied on both axis for particles and Kinetic energy. Information is clearly convayed on where the data coems from in terms of both where in space and from what instrument on IMAP picked up each ion. Additionally, I like how  the instrument key is color and gradient coded, corrisponding to the regions onf analysis. 

 Tgere is a very good use of space wityh very little white/unused space, also contributing to a large data-to-ink ratio. There is also a very low lie factor as there is no real size effect in the graphic or any unecessary style effects. Every feature is also coordinated with a graphical element as color is consistant between instrument and ion pickup region.

In terms of the style guide there is fairly low ambiguity on the graph, as each label and region coorisponds to an key feature in the graph, "Label important events in the data." There is low distortion as there are set units for each axis, and each axis has a low distortion as both are in long scales. Finally there is very little distraction as there are not any unecessary graphical effects.
