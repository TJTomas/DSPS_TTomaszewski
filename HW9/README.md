## Bad Plot

Accoding to standards established in the lecture on visualizations, this plot automatically violates our guidelines by being a pie chart. According to the video, pie charts, "Should be avoided at all times." Sicne the human eye does not intiutively understand pie chart area well. 
Additioanlly, while the plot has low ambiguity, the data is distorted in the pie chart fortmat. The labels themselves are a bit destracting, as the title is not capitalized correctly, "Phase" is included in every label, and the numbering/lettering of the datapoint is inconsistant, starting with a number and then switching to lettering.

Finally, it seems like this data cannot be duplicated since while the paper does outline it does not give exact dates to compute the time distribution, only rough months. The data can be accessed here:

## Good Plot

The bounds are well defined on both axes for particles and Kinetic energy. Information is clearly conveyed on where the data comes from in terms of both where in space and from what instrument on IMAP picked up each ion. Additionally, I like how  the instrument key is color and gradient coded, corresponding to the regions of analysis. 

 There is a very good use of space with very little white/unused space, also contributing to a large data-to-ink ratio. There is also a very low lie factor as there is no real size effect in the graphic or any unnecessary style effects. Every feature is also coordinated with a graphical element as color is consistent between instrument and ion pickup region.

In terms of the style guide there is fairly low ambiguity on the graph, as each label and region corresponds to an key feature in the graph, "Label important events in the data." There is low distortion as there are set units for each axis, and each axis has a low distortion as both are in long scales. Finally there is very little distraction as there are not any unnecessary graphical effects.

## Old Plot

The old plot is from homework 7, coming from the clustering that is done as a part of task six. This plot is exceptionally poor as while it does not have a high ambiguity, it has a high distortion and distraction. The data is distorted as it is hard to see how exactly the points are clustered in the graph and where exactly the points line up on the ladder score. In terms of distraction, the majority of the plot is white space. The white space contributes to a low data-to-ilk ratio and a large lie factor as the plot is physically much larger than it has any real right to be, as distance between cluster points. Finally the score errors don’t make much sense in the legend.
