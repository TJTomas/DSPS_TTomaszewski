# Breakdown of Work
Pi Hacking - Jarod and Katie worked on this both individually, and both helped me with parts of it.
GRB Notebook - I did the majority of this notebook, as Katie was incredibly ill, so she wasn't able to do much. Jarrod helped with quite a bit of the conseptual understanding near the end, going through and making sure that we all understood what each model actually did.
