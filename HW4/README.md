In this homework I worked with Katie Moses and Jarrod Bieber. 
# Team Work
Jarrod did the vast majority of the work on the Dark Matter section of the homework. Katie and I both checked his notebook, but he completed it far before we actually teamed up to work on this homework. For Homework 3 Part II, Katie spent a good deal of time conseptualizing the problem, and the initial code of the problem. I helped get ideas down on the chalkboard for reference, and built out the problem that way, figuring out what we didn't know. Jarrod helped immensely with this part as well. I got the code working with the help of ChatGPT and got everything formatted correctly.
